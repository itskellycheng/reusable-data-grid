This reusable component takes JSON data and loads it into an interactive dat grid.

Each column in the grid is sortable. To sort a column, click on the column header.

The grid has an optional pager that allows users to view the data in susbsets.

This component is written in pure javascript; no external libraries were used.

This was a project for Client Side Web Technologies, Spring 2016.
